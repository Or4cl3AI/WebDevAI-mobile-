# WebDevAI

WebDevAI is a web app that consists of a conversational AI chatbot that can generate a beautiful, fully reactive and interactive landing page from a natural language description. It then gives the user the chance to make any edits also just by chatting, and based on what it has at that point, the chatbot will make 3-5 recommendations for ways to improve it. The app has three tiers: a free tier, a $15/month tier, and a $30/month tier.
